# Description
This is a guide to enable auto-updating Plex Media Server on any QNAP servers
It checks the host architecture for finding the needed build and compares the installed Version with the latest Version based on the Information of the Server Log file.
JQ is needed to run the script

# Instructions

### Download and test the script
1. Download the [`qnap-plex-auto-updater.sh`](/qnap-plex-auto-updater.sh) script onto your QNAP server. For this example, I've placed my script in `/share/homes/user/scripts/qnap-plex-auto-updater.sh`
2. Confirm your plex preferences are stored at `/share/PlexData/Plex\ Media\ Server/Preferences.xml`. If they're not, you'll need to update the location in the script.
3. Run `chmod +x /share/homes/user/scripts/qnap-plex-auto-updater.sh` so your script can be executed
4. Try running the script to ensure it works: `/share/homes/user/scripts/qnap-plex-auto-updater.sh`

### Schedule the script to run periodically
1. Edit you crontab by opening `/etc/config/crontab` directly in your text editor (e.g. `vi` or `nano`)
2. Add the following line `0 5 * * * /share/homes/user/scripts/qnap-plex-auto-updater.sh`
3. Save the file
4. Restart the crontab daemon: `crontab /etc/config/crontab && /etc/init.d/crond.sh restart`
5. Confirm the auto-updater is scheduled by locating the entry after running `crontab -l`

Note: My schedule has it checking for updates everyday at 5am. It's up to you when and how often you want to run it.
